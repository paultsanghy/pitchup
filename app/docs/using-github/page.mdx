# Adding Guides or Device Configurations to Pitchup via GitHub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pitchup! This guide will walk you through the process of adding guides or device configurations using the GitHub web interface. Let's get started!

## Setting Up a GitHub Account

Before you can contribute, you'll need a GitHub account. If you already have one, feel free to skip to the next section. If not, here's how to set one up:

1. Visit [GitHub's homepage](https://github.com/).
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner.
3. Fill in your desired username, email address, and password. Then, click "Create account".
4. Follow the prompts to complete the setup process.

## Adding or Modifying Files

Once you have a GitHub account, you can add or modify files directly in the Pitchup repository.

1. Visit the [Pitchup repository](https://github.com/pitchup-fpv/pitchup).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to add or modify a file.
3. To add a new file, click on "Add file" and then "Create new file". To modify an existing file, click on the file and then click on the pencil icon to edit.
4. If you're adding a new file, give it a name and extension in the "Name your file..." box (for example, "new_guide.mdx" or "new_device.ts").
5. Write or paste your content or code into the large text box.
6. When you're finished, scroll down to the "Commit changes" section. 

## Creating a Pull Request

Instead of committing your changes directly, you'll create a "pull request". This allows the repository maintainers to review your changes before they're added to the project.

1. In the "Commit changes" section, select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".
2. Give your branch a name (for example, "add-new-guide" or "update-device-config").
3. Click on "Propose changes".
4. On the next screen, click on "Create pull request".
5. Give your pull request a title and describe what you've done. Here's a template you can use:

```
Title: Add New Guide for [Device Name]

Description:
This pull request adds a new guide for [Device Name]. In this guide, I cover [briefly describe the content of the guide].
```

6. Once you're done, click on "Create pull request".

That's it! Your changes have been submitted and will be reviewed. You'll be notified once your pull request has been accepted and your changes have been merged into the project. Thank you for contributing to Pitchup!
