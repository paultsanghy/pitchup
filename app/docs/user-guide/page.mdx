# Pitchup User Guide

Pitchup is a web-based wizard that helps you find guides for your FPV gear.

## Getting Started

Pitchup cannot help you pick gear to buy, or tell you whether your gear is compatible. We assume that you already have a set of FPV gear that you want to use together, and that you want to find some help to get you started.

## The Wizard

<div style={{display: "flex", width:"128px", justifyContent: "center", margin: "auto"}}>
    <FontAwesomeIcon fontSize="128px" icon={faHatWizard}/>
</div>

By visiting [pitchup.ldlework.com](https://pitchup.ldlework.com), or clicking the wizard-hat icon in the main menu, you will be presented with a wizard where you can select the gear you have.

There are three categories of gear:
- **Drones**
- **Radios**
- **Goggles**

When you select the drone, radio or goggle you have, additional options may appear. These options are specific to the gear you have selected, and are used to help you find the right guide.

Once you have selected all of your gear, click the **Find Guides** button to see a list of guides that match your gear.

## The Guides

After selecting your gear, you'll be presented with a series of guides applicable to your gear. You can click on any guide, or you can use the Left/Right navigation to head to the first guide:

## Summary

That's about it! You can always return to the wizard to change your gear, or to find more guides.
