# Contributing Guides to Pitchup

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pitchup! This guide will walk you through the process of adding new guides or modifying existing ones. Don't worry, you won't need any special programming skills or technical knowledge beyond the knowedlge you're putting into your guide. Let's get started!

## Overview

Pitchup guides are stored in simple text files that end with ".mdx". These files allow you to format your text using a system called Markdown, which is very easy to learn and use. 

## Adding a New Guide

1. **Choose the right category**: Based on the type of guide you're creating (drone, radio, or goggle), you'll need to find the corresponding folder. These are named `app/drones/`, `app/radios/`, and `app/goggles/`.

2. **Create a new file**: In the chosen folder, create a new text file. Make sure the file ends with ".mdx". For example, if you're writing a guide for the DJI Phantom drone, you could name your file `DJI_Phantom.mdx`.

3. **Write your guide**: Now, you can start writing your guide in the new file. You can use plain text, but to make your guide more readable and engaging, you can use Markdown to format your text. Here are a few basic commands:

   - To create a heading, start the line with a "#". For example, "# This is a heading".
   - To make text bold, surround it with two asterisks. For example, "**This is bold text**".
   - To create a list, start each line with a "-". For example, "- This is a list item".

   Don't worry if you're not familiar with Markdown. It's very easy to learn and there are many online resources available. Also, you can check out other guides to see what they're doing.

4. **Save your guide**: Once you're done writing and formatting your guide, save the file.

## Modifying an Existing Guide

If you want to modify an existing guide, locate the ".mdx" file for the guide you want to change and open it. Make the necessary changes, then save the file.

## Summary

That's it! By following these steps, you can contribute your own guides or modify existing ones. We appreciate your contributions and look forward to seeing your guides on Pitchup!
